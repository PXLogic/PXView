PXView is a GUI program for supporting various instruments from [PXLogic](https://github.com/PXLogic/PXView), including logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, etc. PXView is based on the [sigrok project](https://sigrok.org).

The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform, Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

# Status

The PXView software is in a usable state and has official tarball releases. However, it is still a work in progress. Some basic functionality is available and working, but other things are always on the TODO list.
