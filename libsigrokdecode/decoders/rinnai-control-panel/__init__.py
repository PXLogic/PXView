'''
This Sigrok Protocol Decoder (PD) handles the internal protocol of a Rinnai gas heater control panel.

This PD is based on onewire_link PD.

The protocol is digital and has 0 and 1 encoded with variable pulse length encoding.

Each packet has a sync followed by 48 bits. This forms 6 bytes lsb first.
The first 5 bytes are data and the last is a xor of the first 5.
