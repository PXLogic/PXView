High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented code-transparent 
synchronous data link layer protocol developed by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
The standard for HDLC is ISO/IEC 13239:2002.
If EN is not supplied, data is decoded on every clock transition (depending on clock mode).
